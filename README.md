## Missing Details Form

Hi there! Welcome to the repo.

To get started, do the following:

    1: Run `npm i` to get the deps installed
    2. Run `npm run api` to get the backend started locally
    3. Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend

## data-fetching

The server will run locally on `http://localhost:8081`, please direct all GET requests to this endpoint. We return application/json.

Happy hacking! (and good luck :D)
